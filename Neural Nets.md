Every **Neuron** has only 1 bias. Neuron Output = summation(w * i) + bias 

### To fit non-linear problems with neural networks, we need 2 or more hidden layers.

# Neural Network Concepts and Terms

### Hidden Layers
Layers between the input and output layers where the actual computation is performed.

### Batch Size
Batch size refers to the number of training instances processed together in one iteration during training. For example, if we have a training dataset with 60,000 instances and a batch size of 128, we divide the total dataset size by the batch size to determine the number of batches. 

So, 60,000 / 128 = 468.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a batch, we round up to the nearest whole number, resulting in 469 batches. 

In this scenario, 468 batches consist of 128 training instances each, while the last batch contains the remaining 96 instances. During training, these batches are sequentially fed into the neural network. 

After processing each batch, the error is calculated using a loss function, and this error is used to update the parameters of the network through backpropagation. This process iterates through all the batches, gradually optimizing the network's parameters to improve its performance on the training data.

### Training Steps 
The algorithm starts drawing batches from the dataset. It takes the first 128 instances (first batch) from the dataset, trains the model, calculates the average error, and updates parameters one time (performs one gradient update). This completes one training step (also called iteration). More precisely, a training step (iteration) is one gradient update.

### Epochs
Epochs refer to the number of times the model sees the entire dataset. No. of training steps = No. of batches = No. of gradient updates. One complete pass through the entire training dataset during training of a neural network.

### Fully Connected Layer/ Dense Layer
Each neuron or node from the previous layer is connected to each neuron of the current layer. In CNNs, FC layers often come after the convolutional and pooling layers.

### Activation Function
A function applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network layer, introducing non-linearity into the network. Example activation functions include:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \)
- **Sigmoid**: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \)
- **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**: \( f(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} \)

### Loss Function
A function that measures the difference between the predicted and true target output. Common loss functions include:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: \( \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{\text{true}}^{(i)} - y_{\text{pred}}^{(i)})^2 \)
- **Binary Cross-Entropy**: \( \text{BCE} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ y_{\text{true}}^{(i)} \log(y_{\text{pred}}^{(i)}) + (1 - y_{\text{true}}^{(i)}) \log(1 - y_{\text{pred}}^{(i)}) \right] \)

### Optimizer
An algorithm used to update the weights and biases of a neural network during training. Examples of optimizers include:
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Adam**
- **RMSprop**

### Learning Rate
A hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during optimization. Example learning rates are typically in the range of 0.001 to 0.1.

### Regularization
Techniques used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Examples include:
- **L1 Regularization**: Adds an L1 penalty term to the loss function.
- **L2 Regularization**: Adds an L2 penalty term to the loss function.
- **Dropout**: Randomly ignores neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation.

### Batch Normalization
A technique used to improve the stability and performance of neural networks by normalizing the inputs to each layer.

### Pooling
A downsampling operation used in convolutional neural networks to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps. Example pooling operations include:
- **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value within a window.
- **Average Pooling**: Takes the average value within a window.

### Padding
Adding extra pixels or values around the edges of an image or feature map to maintain the size of the output. Example padding types include:
- **Zero Padding**: Adds zero values around the edges.
- **Constant Padding**: Adds constant values around the edges.

### Backpropagation
An algorithm used to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the neural network, used to update the parameters during training.

### Transfer Learning
A technique where a pre-trained neural network is used as a starting point for training a new model on a different task or dataset.

### Hyperparameters
Parameters set before training, such as learning rate and batch size.

### Vanishing Gradient Problem
A problem during training of deep neural networks where gradients become very small, causing slow convergence.

### Exploding Gradient Problem
The opposite of the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become very large during training, causing numerical instability.

### Weight Initialization
Techniques used to initialize the weights of a neural network layer, such as random initialization and Xavier initialization.

### Early Stopping
A technique used to prevent overfitting by monitoring the performance of the model on a separate validation dataset and stopping training when performance starts to degrade.

- **Intuition:** VAEs aim to learn a low-dimensional representation of input data that captures the underlying structure of the data distribution. They achieve this by mapping input data points to a probabilistic latent space, where each point represents a potential configuration of the input data.

- **Concept:** The core concept behind VAEs is to learn a probability distribution over the latent space, typically a Gaussian distribution, from which new data points can be generated. The encoder network maps input data points to the latent space, while the decoder network reconstructs input data points from samples drawn from the latent space distribution.

They consist of an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence while attending to relevant parts of the input.

- **Intuition:** Attention mechanisms mimic human attention by allowing the model to selectively focus on certain parts of the input sequence, giving more importance to relevant information. This enables the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant predictions.

- **Concept:** The core concept of attention networks is the attention mechanism, which assigns different weights to different parts of the input sequence based on their relevance to the current step of the decoding process. These weights are dynamically calculated by the model and used to generate context vectors, which capture the most important information for each step of decoding.

- **Intuition:** GANs are inspired by the concept of a game between a counterfeiter (the generator) and a detective (the discriminator). The counterfeiter tries to produce counterfeit currency (fake data) that is indistinguishable from real currency (real data), while the detective aims to distinguish between real and counterfeit currency.

- **Concept:** The generator learns to map random noise vectors to realistic data samples, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated samples. Through an adversarial training process, both networks improve iteratively, with the generator producing increasingly realistic samples and the discriminator becoming more discerning.

By incorporating gating mechanisms, the network can selectively retain important information over multiple time steps, facilitating better learning and capturing of long-term dependencies in sequential data.

- **Concept:** Gating mechanisms in neural networks are inspired by the gating mechanisms found in biological systems, such as the human brain. These mechanisms allow neurons to regulate the flow of information based on its relevance and importance, improving the network's ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in sequential data.
